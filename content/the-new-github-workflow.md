# The New GitHub Workflow...

..is awesome.

With GitHub, I just created a branch in the UI. I called it "test" because I'm not that witty.

Then, with GitHub, I created a new file, called `the-new-github-workflow.md`. It's up there :point_up:. I also wrote the content in Zen Mode. The commit message was written for me.

I then was able to create a pull request and :boat: this :baby: to the master branch. 

When each of these features were created, with the exception of possibly the Pull Request, it was viewed as a minor 
addition. However, all of these things taken together has revolutionized the way that I write. I expect that, in a few more ships, this will forever change the way that many people program, or learn to program.

It's hard to really predict which of these features will be the one that makes these revolutionary jumps possible. The one that finally reaches the tipping point. The one that we remember, and the one that matters. In my time at GitHub, I've noticed that we too are human, and cannot truly predict the globally resounding changes that shape us.

But, we built like it is. 

Every feature as treated as if it _could_ become the great game changer. Not through arrogance, but through 
responsibility. There are no sloppy ships here. Nothing slips by, and nothing is haphazardly wedged in. Everything is 
treated as though it could start the next great paradigm shift, and everything is loved like it should. 


_edit_: I also misspelled an Emoji. But I was able to correct it in the UI.
