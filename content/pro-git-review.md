# Pro Git Review

I work at GitHub. But, I don't know everything there is to know about Git. It's kind of fun. Luckily, I work with some of the best Git geniuses around, including Git core team members, and the guy who [wrote the book on the damned thing](http://git-scm.com/book).

I finally got a chance to read the book, and I thought it was fair to write a review on the experience. You can read it [here](http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IDEUTAC3NWZT), but heres a copy below:

I'm a Git pro now

I read this book, and my life truly changed. Chacon is a wizard of words, and a guru of the complex and powerful VCS known as Git. If you want to program harder and faster than ever before, cuddle up around the calming glow of a computer monitor with this tasteful novella of dreams.

Soon, your code will get better, and your boss will begin to notice that spring in your step at your weekly standup. He'll say "You there -- the smart, good looking one -- you seem to be at the top of your game." He (or she) will call you into your office and promote you. That office will become yours, and you your boss will relegate himself to your former cubicle out of sheer appreciation for your skills. You'll stop standups, because they're horrible and you won't need them anymore . You're a Git pro now. Your life will never be the same, and the future will be your oyster to shuck. So shuck away dear reader, and prepare to unleash your dreams into the firm grip of reality.
