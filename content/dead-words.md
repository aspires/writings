# These Words Are Dead

May they rest in peace. They were once good, strong words in the english language. They were used well, and helped to
weave great writings. However, they were taken from us. Factory farmed for emotion. Their value has been worn down to
sub-cliche, and they deserve to be retired. These are the dead words:

- Compelling
- Utilize
- Facilitate
- Assist
- Advise
- Catalyst
- Engaging

# Can they be reborn?

I suppose so. Language is dynamic and alive. Perhaps life may be breathed into them again.
