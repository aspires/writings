# Humanity matters more

The “modern consumer” often claims they don’t want to interact with people when buying or using things in the Internet age. It seems logical. Why should someone have to go through human theater to get to a mutual end goal.

But after some time, I’ve changed my assumptions about this modern product-consumer interaction. People claim that they don't want human interaction in the age of the modern web, but it's not true when you review their choices. What they want is to remove the risk of bad human interaction. So they choose the safe route and throw the baby out with the bathwater by preferring to avoid all interaction initially. With this, they miss the truly amazing experiences that can come with human interaction.

GrubHubbing from a restaurant will never be the same as going to their location and having a great dining experience withs friend. But, it lets you skip lines, and your food arrives on time without any unforeseen hassle. When you compare the two, it seems silly to GrubHub. But only if the dining experience is truly great every time. People choose consistency over quality experiences.

The companies and products that people truly love are high on opt-in human interaction, and have removed as much crap from the product process as possible thanks to the internet and product decisions. They’ve done everything possible to eliminate the common causes of these bad interruptions, and cranked human interaction to 11, and that's what builds fanatical users. You don’t have to wait in line, or get dressed to purchase most software these days. But if you want, you can usually interact in a meaningful way with another person in the process.

The best companies will figure out how to get the best of both worlds — consistency, immediacy, _and_ humanity. But, it’s the humanity that makes the superfans.
