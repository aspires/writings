As of now, I have a 64GB microsd card and a USB reader for for that card. On the card is a small parition containing Ubuntu 12.04 larger parition containing my casper-rw storage. With this I can plug in the USB reader and boot from the microsd card. I have a personal configuration and other fun things that are stored locally. There's 64 gigs, so I can keep a lot of things.

The entire setup was less than $75 and is the size of my thumbnail. I could have shelled out another $100 and doubled my storage if I wanted to.

All in all, this isn't new tech. It's been possible for years. But, it's still really cool. It's super easy to do, and I'd reccomend that you get a similar setup if possible.
