# If you're selling sex, you're destined to fail.

```
Peggy Olson: Sex sells. 
Don Draper: Says who? Just so you know, the people who talk that way
think that monkeys can do this. They take all this monkey crap and just
stick it in a briefcase completely unaware that their success depends on
something more than their shoeshine. YOU are the product. You- FEELING
something. That's what sells. Not them. Not sex. They can't do what we
do, and they hate us for it.

Mad Men has a bad reputation in some circles. But, the show does have the 
occasional bit of true wisdom regarding the human condition and business. 
This is one of my favorites.

Its painfully sad to see companies, specifically those in the valley,
use tactics like these. This marketing technique has been accurately
described as anti-women, sexist, gender biased, and hurtful. I agree.

But, not only are these showing a disrespect for 50% of humanity with these
tactics, it shows a stanch disrespect for their own product, their users,
and their business.

When I see tactics like this in action, I know the company isn't doing
well. The company is grasping for users,let alone revenues or profits 
by any means necessary. The product is obviously not meeting a real need, 
and the company can't create any real community around itself. So, they're 
resorting to a tactic one step removed from email spam to generate traffic.

If your marketing director thinks that selling sex is the best way to
drum up users, get a new one.
