# My Writings

I recently decided that I would shelve my blog. This repo is where I now
keep my writing, commentary, ideas, and other thoughts. Thanks for
reading.

## Why did you leave the blog?

For some reason, I've never truly felt comfortable with the "blog"
medium for my own work. There are a few inherent rules regarding the
blog format that I didn't like, to the point where scrapping the whole
platform seemed appropriate. Thats not to say that blogs aren't a great
thing. I love reading blogs of all types. I just wasn't happy writing
one for a few reasons.

Blogs, for the most part, are organized by date, and older posts
generally fall into the abyss of page archives. Any revisions,
additions, or changes made are often worthless. This was something I
wanted to avoid. I view mostly everything you see in this repo as a WIP,
simply because _I_ am a WIP. My experience changes. My opinion changes.
My writing should be able to change. As a corollary to this, the
revision process is, in my opinion, real and valid work. I want older
versions of these publications to be searchable. It's ok to see my
thought process, my errors, and where I've changed directions.

The design of the modern blog is not something I feel is appropriate for
the bulk of my writing. I'm not talking about visual layouts with this 
point. I'm specifically referring to the way that most blog homepages 
are displayed. For an example of this, take a look at [the GitHub
blog](http://www.github.com/blog). The most recent articles are displayed
prominently, and it's easy to dive into the to first few posts. Though
engaging, this is not what I want. In contrast, my coworker [Zach
Holman](http://zachholman.com/) has a layout closer to my goal: an index
of topics to allow for a methodical scan. Zach's posts are still
organized by date, which I've already stated that I'm against for my
writing. But, it's a close approximation.

I don't want to optimize my titles. I love the modern copywriting
movement. It's fascinating, and I practice the process of writing
engaging copy every day. My job depends on it. But, it doesn't belong
here. It may not be appropriate for one of my pieces to have a
title, let alone one that's been overly thought out and designed to attract
an audience. Some of these posts may end up reading like a traditional
linkbait blog post. But, I don't want that constraint with this
endeavor.

I'm a horrible visual designer, for two reasons. First, I don't have the
skill or vision to build a perfect blog layout. Secondly, I'm never
happy with a blog layout I've implemented, whatever it is. Most of the 
time I've written a post, I end up spending 30 minutes scanning my 
existing design, tweaking the layout, and experimenting with new option.
It's fun, but slightly frustrating. Most importantly, I'm not 
actually _writing_. Using GitHub as my medium will remove these visual 
design decisions, so I can actually focus on writing. Also, GitHub employs 
the [greatest visual and UX design team](https://github.com/blog/search?q=design) 
in world. They are now in charge of my layout, and I am happy for that.

Also, putting my writings on GitHub is freeing. From a reach
perspective, GitHub has a huge audience. Most importantly, I'll never be
tethered to a specific blogging tool or platform. Right now I write in
Markdown, to make linking easy. But, text is text. I can easily pull
this repo down and push it somewhere else. I can have infinite copies. I
can be free from the decisions of a blogging company that may have a
different vision than my own. Of course, I could self host my articles,
but that would negate my above point about design.

Apologies for the long winded explanation. Please read any enjoy. If
you'd like to discuss a specific article, creating an issue may be the
best way to start this.

I suppose I'll accept most pull requests. If these writings are in fact
living documents, I'll take all the help I can get :smile:
